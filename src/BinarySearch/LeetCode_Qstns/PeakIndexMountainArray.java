// https://leetcode.com/problems/peak-index-in-a-mountain-array/

/*
    Approach :
    1. We know its a Mountain Array, So we have to find the peak element.
    2. We will find the mid element and check whether the mid is greater than mid + 1.
    3. if arr[mid] > arr[mid + 1] it means we are in the descending part of the arr
    4. so we will check the left side of mid for peak. ie. end = mid + 1
    5. if arr[mid] < arr[mid + 1] it means we are in the ascending part
    6. so we will check the right side for peak i.e start = mid + 1
    7. at last start and end both will point on the peal element ... so return end or start
